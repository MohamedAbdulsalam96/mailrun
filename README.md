This project was started during [OSSHack](https://osshack.com) to simplify marketing features which are available in [Frappe framework](https://frappeframework.com).

Things that work: list views with skeleton loaders and errpr states, Tiptap editor with in-line formatting (bubble menu) and Slash commands. 

Need to figure out how to apply the same styles to the email when sending it. 

Longer term vision for this project would be to make it the go-to marketing management app for all Frappe and [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) users.
